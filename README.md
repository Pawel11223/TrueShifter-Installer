# TrueShifter

TrueShifter is a dual-MCU bridge that translates bHaptics BLE protocols into TrueGear protocols in real time. It allows TrueGear haptic vests to be recognized natively as a TactSuit X40 within the ecosystem.

This enables native haptic feedback without requiring background services, driver installations, or game modifications.

## Supported Platforms
* **PCVR** (via bHaptics Player on Windows)
* **Meta Quest Standalone** 
* **Pico Standalone** 
* **Mobile** (bHaptics Player for Android / iOS)

## Web Installer
You can flash the pre-compiled firmware directly to your ESP32 boards using a Chromium-based browser (Chrome, Edge). No drivers or IDE installation required.

**[Launch TrueShifter Web Installer](https://pawel11223.github.io/TrueShifter/)**

## Hardware Requirements
* 2x **ESP32-WROOM-32** development boards
* Jumper wires
* 5V USB Power source

> **⚠️ Board Compatibility:**  
> The pre-compiled web installer uses GPIO 16 & 17. Due to hardware differences, the following boards are **NOT supported** out of the box:
> * **ESP32-WROVER** - *Will crash*. These boards use pins 16/17 for PSRAM.
> * **ESP8266** (NodeMCU, Wemos D1) - Hardware does not support Bluetooth BLE.
> * **ESP32-S2** - Hardware does not support Bluetooth BLE.
> * **Mini/Micro boards** (e.g., ESP32-C3 SuperMini/Mini) - Lack physical pins 16/17. *(You can still use them if you compile the project from source and reassign the UART pins manually).*

## Wiring Diagram
The two boards communicate via hardware UART. Connect the pins as shown below:

| Board 1 (Protocol Translator) | Connection | Board 2 (TrueGear Bridge) | Description |
| :--- | :---: | :--- | :--- |
| **GND** | ↔ | **GND** | Common ground (Crucial for UART) |
| **VIN (or 5V)** | ↔ | **VIN (or 5V)** | Power sharing (Powers both via one USB) |
| **GPIO 17 (TX2)** | → | **GPIO 16 (RX2)** | Haptic data stream (1 to 2) |
| **GPIO 16 (RX2)** | ← | **GPIO 17 (TX2)** | Haptic data stream (2 to 1) |
